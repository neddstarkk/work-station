# WorkStation 🖥️
🎊 Script to Set Up New PC with required software 🎊

## Getting Started
Developers or students find it really annoying when they reinstall their OS, though they have a data back up,
maybe (sometimes not), they loose all the important data tools that they installed and used daily.
Installing utilities to make your PC/Laptop a beast is a big headache. And it takes a toll on your small life ⌛

*I don't remember how many github issues I've visited to install Node and Android SDK* 

Well, there is this script here now, called workstation.py in this repository, which works is python3
is installed on your "System"

## Using WorkStation
Clone this repository and cd into the work-station/ directory, though this script installs git, if you already have it installed you can simply use

`git clone https://github.com/rshrc/work-station/ && cd work-station`
 
Once you are into the work-station directory, time to learn the arguments, lol 😂😂😂

I guess, I'll first show an example on how to use the script in the first place 😀

*Don't judge me by the extensive stupid thoughts I've put into writing the argument short cuts or the script itself*

`python3 workstation.py --gzt True`

This is the most basic of the script that gets Git, tmux and Oh-My-Zsh installed on your PC. It appends a few lines of code to your ~/.zshrc file too, just for the namesake of making this script extra cool 💓

## List of Arguments
By default all the arguments take False, you the one, the chosen one, chooses the stuff to be installed 🔥🔥🔥
`
--gtz   - Git, tmux and Oh-My-Zsh
--pylib - Python and Machine Learning Libraries
--dj    - Most commanly used Django Apps and django 2.0.8, which works, unlike the 2.1 
--fend  - All the stack you need, Node, npm, Angular, React.. Go Figure !!
--android - Yeah, this... It still does'nt work quite alright.. Try Installing Android Studio, it does it all

## I broke someone's PC
Well, I wrote this, so that I dont have to go through the pain of installing everything all over again! LawL
